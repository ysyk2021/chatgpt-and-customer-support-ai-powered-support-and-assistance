Chatbots are computer programs designed to simulate conversation with human users through text-based or voice-based interactions. They use natural language processing (NLP) and machine learning algorithms to understand and interpret human language and generate contextually relevant responses.

Artificial intelligence (AI) refers to the ability of computer systems to perform tasks that typically require human-level intelligence, such as visual perception, speech recognition, decision-making, and language translation. AI systems use machine learning, deep learning, and other advanced computational techniques to learn from data and improve their performance over time.

In customer support, chatbots and AI can be used to provide personalized support, automate routine tasks, analyze customer data, and more.
